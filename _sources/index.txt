Notices
=======
Welcome to the new PyGMI website! It contains more information, including API documentation for the project.

July 12, 2016: `PyGMI 2.2.11 <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi/releases/tag/v2.2.11>`_ is now released.

PyGMI is now being developed using python 3.5. It may still work on older versions, however.

Overview
========

PyGMI stands for Python Geophysical Modelling and Interpretation. It is a modelling and interpretation suite aimed at magnetic, gravity and other datasets.

PyGMI is developed at the `Council for Geoscience <http://www.geoscience.org.za>`_ (Geological Survey of South Africa).

It includes:

* Magnetic and Gravity 3D forward modelling
* Cluster Analysis
* Routines for cutting, reprojecting and doing simple modifications to data
* Convenient display of data using pseudo-color, ternary and sunshaded representation.
* It is released under the `Gnu General Public License version 3.0 <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`_
