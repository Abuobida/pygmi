Raster Analysis: Description of Modules
---------------------------------------

Import Raster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module imports raster data using the GDAL library, including ENVI, ER Mapper, Geotiff, Geosoft GXF and Surfer. It is possible to connect multiple imports to another module, thereby creating a 'merged' dataset.

Equation Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The equation editor allows for operations to be performed on either single or multiple bands of data. It works like a calculator.

Smoothing
^^^^^^^^^
Allows for the smoothing of data using mean, median and mode filters. These filters can have either a box window or a disk window. In addition, the mean filter can be defined by a Gaussian window.

Normalisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allows for the normalisation of data. It can be normalised to either:

1. Interval of between zero and one
2. Mean of zero, with standard deviation of unity
3. Median of zero, with absolute deviation of unity
4. 8 bit histogram equalisation

Horizontal Gradients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Calculates the raster gradients (Cooper 2007) by azimuth, elevation and order.

Visibility
^^^^^^^^^^
Computes visibility (Cooper 2005) as a textural measure using window size and viewing height (% standard deviation)

Tilt
^^^^
Calculates the tilt angle (Cooper 2006) of the raster data.

Merge and Resampling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This tool is used to merge and resample datasets. It is only necessary when raster data must have the same extents and sample or cell size.

Reprojection
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module reprojects the data using the GDAL libraries. The interface allows for either Transverse Mercator, or UTM projections, or EPSG code input for full flexibility. 

EPSG codes are available online at either:

* http://www.epsg-registry.org/
* http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/ 
* In the gcs.csv and pcs.csv files in your python GDAL\\data directory.

Cut Data
^^^^^^^^
This tool provided an quick way to cut out raster data, using a shape file as the boundary for the cut, and a larger raster file to cut from. You will need to prepare the shape file in another package first.

Get Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^
This tool provided an quick way to extract a 1D profile from a raster dataset, using a shape file for the coordinates of the profile. You will need to prepare the shape file in another package first. Profiles can be exported or displayed via the context menu.

Grid Point Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module grids point data using the !SciPy griddata routine. It used default settings (linear interpolation), and is meant as a convenience function only. This routine takes as input Point Data which is imported via the Point Data menu.

Calculate IGRF Corrected Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module calculates the IGRF and subtracts it from your magnetic data. It will also store the IGRF field as an additional dataset. Please pay careful attention to define the input raster projection correctly, as this will affect results. The IGRF corrected is a translated version of the correction supplied at: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html

Raster Data Interpretation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module allows for the flexible display of data using either a single colour map to data, a ternary of three data bands, or a sun shading image. The shader used is Blinnâ€™s formula (Horn, 1981). 

The sun shading image in particular differs from traditional sun shading in that it also includes two additional parameters:

* Sunshade detail
* Light reflectance
