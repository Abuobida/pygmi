Installation
============

PyGMI is a 3D geophysical modelling program designed for the interpretation and modelling of magnetic and gravity data. It uses a voxel based system to achieve this. It currently supports forward-modelling.

Download
--------
PyGMI can be downloaded through `GitHub <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi/releases>`_.

Requirements
------------
PyGMI will run on both Windows and Linux, as well as Python 2.7 and Python 3.3. It should be noted that the main development is done in Python 3.3 on Windows.

PyGMI requires the following libraries in order to function:

* Python 3.3.5 or 2.7.6
* Numpy 1.8.1
* Scipy 0.13.3
* Matplotlib 1.3.1
* PyQt 4.9.6
* GDAL 1.10.1
* numexpr 2.3.1

Windows
-------
I have now made available convenient installers for PyGMI, thanks to `Cyrille Rossant <http://cyrille.rossant.net/tag/winpython/>`_. If you have already installed PyGMI using this installer, you can simply update it using the smaller pygmi_update.exe file. This smaller update file contains all the python code, if you are only interested in that.

Linux
-----
Linux normally comes with python installed, but the additional libraries will still need to be installed. The software has been tested on Ubuntu 13.10 linux, using Python 2.7

* Install libraries (shown below for Ubuntu 13.10)::

   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get install python-numpy
   sudo apt-get install python-scipy
   sudo apt-get install python-qt4
   sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
   sudo apt-get install python-gdal
   sudo apt-get install python-numexpr
   sudo apt-get install cython
   sudo apt-get install libqt4-opengl
   sudo apt-get install python-qt4-gl

* Extract the zip file.
* Execute the following command from within the root of the PyGMI directory to run the program::

   python quickstart.py


Troubleshooting
---------------
Q: I get a crash when I try to calculate the forward model under Windows.

A: More than likely your version of python is too old for pre-compiled code I include for the windows install. It should be solved by downloading the larger install and reinstalling everything.
