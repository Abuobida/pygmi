Installation
============

PyGMI is a 3D geophysical modelling program designed for the interpretation and modelling of magnetic and gravity data. It uses a voxel based system to achieve this. It currently supports forward-modelling.

Download
--------
PyGMI can be downloaded through `GitHub <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi/releases>`_.

Requirements
------------
PyGMI will run on both Windows and Linux. It should be noted that the main development is done in Python 3.4 on Windows.

PyGMI is developed and has been tested with the following libraries in order to function:

* Python 3.4.1
* NumPy 1.8.2
* SciPy 0.14.0
* Matplotlib 1.3.1
* PyQt 4.10.4
* GDAL 1.11.0
* numexpr 2.4

It is possible that it might work on earlier versions, especially on non-windows operating systems. Under windows, there are compiled .pyd files (python version of a dll) which require the NumPy and Python version to match. However, for actual releases, I do post windows binaries which include a standalone python distribution (that will not interfere with existing installations), so this should not be a problem.

Installation
------------

General
^^^^^^^
If you satisfy the requirements, and wish to run PyGMI from within your python environment, you can install PyGMI as a library using the following command from within the root of the PyGMI directory::

   python setup.py install

Once you are in python, you can run PyGMI by using the following commands::

   import pygmi
   pygmi.main()


Windows
^^^^^^^
I have now made available convenient installers for PyGMI, thanks to `Cyrille Rossant <http://cyrille.rossant.net/tag/winpython/>`_. If you have already installed PyGMI using this installer, you can simply update it using the smaller pygmi_update.exe file. This smaller update file contains only the python code, if you are only interested in that.

Running the software can be acheived through the shortcut on your desktop.

Linux
^^^^^
Linux normally comes with python installed, but the additional libraries will still need to be installed. The software has been tested on Ubuntu 13.10 linux, using Python 2.7

* Install libraries (shown below for Ubuntu 13.10)::

   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get install python-numpy
   sudo apt-get install python-scipy
   sudo apt-get install python-qt4
   sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
   sudo apt-get install python-gdal
   sudo apt-get install python-numexpr
   sudo apt-get install cython
   sudo apt-get install libqt4-opengl
   sudo apt-get install python-qt4-gl

* Extract the zip file.
* Execute the following command from within the root of the PyGMI directory to run the program::

   python quickstart.py

* Alternatively you can install it as a library as shown above.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Q: I get a crash when I try to calculate the forward model under Windows.

A: More than likely your version of python is too old for pre-compiled code I include for the windows install. It should be solved by downloading the larger install and reinstalling everything.
