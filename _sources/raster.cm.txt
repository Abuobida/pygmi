Raster Analysis: Context Menu
-----------------------------

The raster context menus are available for modules which have raster output data. Output data is only available on green modules. To access the context menu, simply right-click a green module.

Basic Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This shows statistics with respect to the output data. The statistics can be saved in a text file. They include:

* Minimum
* Maximum
* Mean
* Standard Deviation
* Median
* Median Absolute Deviation
* Number of samples
* Number of columns
* Number of rows
* Skewness
* Kurtosis

Show Raster Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is convenient display for raster data. 

Show Hexbin Plot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A hexbin plot is a type of scatter gram, where the points on the scatter gram are binned, and the amplitude of the bins are shown in colour. The scale of the amplitudes is given in log in order to increase the amount of information on the plot.

Show Histogram
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This shows the histogram for a band of data.

Show 2D Correlation Coefficients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 2D correlation coefficients show the degree of correlation between all the bands in a dataset. It is sometimes used in cluster analysis as a preparatory step in order to exclude bands of information which are too similar.

Export Data
^^^^^^^^^^^
This exports the raster data into a variety of raster formats, including ENVI, ER Mapper, Geotiff, Geosoft GXF and Surfer. In most cases the GDAL library was used.
