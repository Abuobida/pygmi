Notices
=======
Welcome to the PyGMI website! It contains more information, including API documentation for the project.

December 6, 2019: `PyGMI 3.0.1 <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi/releases>`_ is now released.

This is the next release of PyGMI. It contains various bug fixes and introduces new menus for processing of geophysical data. This includes the amazing `mtpy <https://github.com/MTgeophysics/mtpy>`_ library for MT processing, as well as `segyio <https://pypi.org/project/segyio/>`_ for reading SEG-Y data to view. This is the start of (hopefully) something big in terms of expanding the geoscience capabilities of PyGMI.

PyGMI is being developed using python 3.7 and Qt5.

If there are requests or concerns, please contact me.

Overview
========

PyGMI stands for Python Geoscience Modelling and Interpretation. It is a modelling and interpretation suite aimed at magnetic, gravity and other datasets.

PyGMI is developed at the `Council for Geoscience <http://www.geoscience.org.za>`_ (Geological Survey of South Africa).

It includes:

* Magnetic and Gravity 3D forward modelling
* Cluster Analysis
* Routines for cutting, reprojecting and doing simple modifications to data
* Convenient display of data using pseudo-color, ternary and sunshaded representation.
* It is released under the `Gnu General Public License version 3.0 <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`_

View the PyGMI project on `GitHub <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi>`_!

The latest release version (including windows installers) can be found `here <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi/releases>`_.

You may need to install the `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-visual-c>`_.

If you have any comments or queries, you can contact the author either through `GitHub <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi>`_ or via email at pcole@geoscience.org.za
