Seismology Data Analysis
========================

Introduction
------------
The Seismology Menu is a where operations on earthquake seismology data reside.
Here, SEISAN data can be imported, and some basic operations performed on it.
If another menu requires seismology data, then it should be imported through
this menu.

It should be noted that some of the functions are really meant for for internal
use at the Council for Geoscience (such as the importing of scanned bulletins),
and may not be that useful. In spite of this I have chosen to include these
modules if only to serve as examples on how to approach these problems from a
coding point of view.

All seismology modules, once activated (module will be green) have a context
menu which allows the export of the data. The context menu is accessed by
**right clicking** on the module.
