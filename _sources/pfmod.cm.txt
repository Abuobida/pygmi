Potential Field Modelling: Context Menu
=======================================
The potential field modelling context menus are available for modules which
have output 3D model data. Output data is only available on green modules. To
access the context menu, simply **right-click** a green module.


3D Model Display
----------------
The 3D model display menu provides a viewer for 3D voxel data. The model can be
rotated using the left and right click buttons on your mouse. The
**mouse wheel** provides zooming of the model.

By default the model is semi-transparent. By selecting a lithology from the
lithology menu, that lithology becomes opaque. The background opacity can also
be varied. The viewer provides a means to save an image of the model to a .jpg
or .png file format.

Export 3D Model
---------------
This provides a means to export the model in one of 3 formats:

* npz - this is the format adopted for 3D models in PyGMI.
* kmz - this is google earths 3D format
* xyz - this is an ASCII format, supplied to export the model in a generic
  fashion.
