Seismology Analysis: Description of Modules
-------------------------------------------

Import Seisan Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Imports SEISAN data stored in the NORDIC format.

Import Generic FPS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Imports generic fault plane solutions stored in an ASCII file. This is stored
in a csv file. The format is as follows::

   Longitude, Latitude, Strike, Dip, Rake, Magnitude

Import Scanned Bulletins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Imoprts ASCII seismic bulletins which have been obtained from Optical Character
Recognition software. The bulletins are from the Council for Geoscience, and
this forms part of an initiative converting paper records to digital records.

The module will convert the ASCII file to NORDIC format. Errors in conversion
are also displayed.

Fault Plane Solutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module allows for the display of fault plane solutions as beachball plots.
The beachball plots can be exported to shapefiles. Note that two shapefiles are
exported - one for the actual beachballs and one for a boundary of the
beachballs.

The core code is translated from bb.m written by Andy Michael and Oliver Boyd
at http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/olboyd/Software/Software.html

Delete Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a simple script used to delete records.

Remove Quarry Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This script allows for the removal of quarry events from seismology data. It is
based on the paper by Wiemer and Baer (2000)
